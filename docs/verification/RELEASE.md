# DesignHub V1 Release Verification

Status: prepared for execution. This record distinguishes browser preview evidence from native Electron, real-provider, and signed-package evidence.

## REL01: Spring Market end-to-end journey

1. Create a local workspace.
2. Create designer A from a description and confirm its persona draft.
3. Create a project manually, import the original artwork, and request two directions.
4. Edit Chinese copy, then switch to designer B and request a background change.
5. Create a square related document, select final revisions for both documents, export PNGs, and create a project package.
6. Open the package in a second workspace/device and verify history, source assets, offline editing, and A/B contribution attribution.

Expected evidence: final PNG magic/dimensions/pixels, two final revision IDs, immutable A/B contribution records, package manifest and SHA-256 values.

## REL02: alternate creation paths

- Conversation creation produces a reviewable brief task and does not create a project before confirmation.
- Portfolio creation requires rights confirmation, selected sources, and produces a reviewable designer draft.

## REL03: provider disclosure and cancellation

- First original-image upload shows scope, destination, and cost unknown when not provider-confirmed.
- Missing connection, cancellation, rate limiting, partial candidate failure, and unknown remote result each provide a concrete recovery action.

## Native and release gates

- [ ] macOS packaged Electron: main/preload paths, native module unpacking, credential persistence, upgrade/uninstall data retention.
- [ ] Windows packaged Electron: the same checks on a real Windows host.
- [ ] Signed/notarized artifacts and exact hashes recorded.
- [ ] Real provider adapters, licensed image-tool samples, and 100-project/long-history performance sample.

Browser preview tests are not evidence for the native gates above. No release artifact is uploaded by this plan.
